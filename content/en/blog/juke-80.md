This is one of my favorite bars in Tokyo. It's a music request bar that specializes in 80s music, both American and Japanese. A projector shows music videos for extra ambiance. There isn't a table charge and there's a 500 yen menu, so it's perfect for hangouts on a budget. The staff is friendly is happy to help foreigners. English menus are available.
