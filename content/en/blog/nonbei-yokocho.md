Nonbei Yokocho is a great place to spend a night eating and drinking. Like all Yokocho it's an alley or neighborhood filled with izakayas, small pubs, and specialty restaurants. Unlike most yokocho though it's very close to the shibuya crossing which makes it convienient and easy to go to after a day of shopping, seeing music at a live house, etc.
