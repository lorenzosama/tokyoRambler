Nakano Broadway is a shopping mall that contains a huge amount of anime, vintage, secondhand, and niche products. I think of it as a second Akihabara. There aren't maid cafe's, there's more of a place where fans have taken over rather than corporations. The biggest store is Mandrake, a secondhand manga store, but the mall is filled with vast numbers of independent stores that carry everything from tin toys, art exhibits, to expensive watches. I've found great deals and rare items while exploring.

The nearby area is also filled with things to do. There's a Namco arcade, delicious izakaya for blocks, and unique bars. I'd highly recommend Juke 80s
