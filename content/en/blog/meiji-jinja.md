Meiji Jingu is a Shinto Shrine dedicated to the Emperor Meiji. It is located in Harajuku, five minutes from the station next to Yoyogi park. The road to the shrine begins with a giant Torii gate. Once you enter it's as if you're transported to another world. Despite being in the middle of the city you won't see or hear any traffic or outside noise. Along the walk to the shrine is a garden.

Once inside Meiji Jingu you'll be surrounded by one of the biggest shrine squares. There's a giant area for writing wishes on a board. Please try it out and read the wishes of others

After visiting you'll have easy access to Yoyogi Park and Harajuku.
