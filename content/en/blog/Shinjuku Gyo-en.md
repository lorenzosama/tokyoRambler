A National Park located in both Shinjuku and Shibuya. This is the perfect spot for hanami (Cherry blossom viewing), relaxing, or going on a date. Inside is a traditional tea house and a pavillion for gazing at nature. For the more modern guest there's a nice starbucks inside. Admission isn't free but is cheap at Â¥500 per person. This location is heavily featured in the Makoto Shinkai movie "The Garden of Words"
